# McDuo's
People can like (or skip) each other based on a fun / crazy photo taken with a 
McDonalds product that he / she likes best. This way they can get to know people
who love the same product of the McDonalds as much as they do. In this way
beautiful friendships can develop!

I designed the application for the Iphone X, it's not responsive.
